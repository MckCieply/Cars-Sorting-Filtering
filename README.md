# CarsSortingFiltering
## Program written for passing grade on university
## It enables you to search textfile (used as "database") for a specific car model within a mileage and price range, 
## also it makes possible to edit records, where you can chose record to overwrite by typing ID of this record
## only supporting 3 models, VW Scirocco, Volvo c30 and Mitsubishi Lancer
## Also I addapted primitive input control to prevent user from crashing and/or bamboozling program
### Project is using data from my former Django project, but converted from SQLite to .txt file to ease adaptation
Former Java-Pass-Project
